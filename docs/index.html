	<h3>Running RingdateR on your computer </h3>

  <p> There are currently a couple of ways to run RingdateR on your own compute,
    either use the standalone version or run it using RStudio. </p>

  <h3> RingdateR Standalone (Windows only)</h3>

  <div class="online">
    <ul><li><a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1D6b8sDbQ4F_6k0bP5f0YfXZyAyElUfe_">
      <b>Download RingdateR standalone</b></a>
    </li></ul>
  </div>

  <p> If you're a windows user, the standalone version of RingdateR will allow you to use
    RingdateR without needing to do anything with R. Simply download the zip file from our google
    drive using the link above. Unzip the folder and run the setup_ringdater installation wizard.

    Once installed, RingdateR can then be launched from the desktop shortcut or by from the Start
    program menu. On first launch, RingdateR installs all the dependencies needed (included in the
    download) automatically
   </p>

  <p><b> Note the standalone installer is currently in beta form. Please get in touch if
    you encounter problems </b></p>

  <p> After launch you can modify the appearance of RingdateR usingthe ctrl + and ctrl - to
    scale the display to your screen. Additionally text sizes can be modified usingthe toggelable
    menu on the left of the screen. </p>

  <h3> RingdateR in R studio </h3>
  <p>RingdateR can be installed as a package in Rstudio.
  The package can be downloaded and installed directly from Github using the following code:</p>
	<p>install.packages("devtools")&nbsp;</p>
	<p> library(devtools)</p>
	<p> devtools::install_github("ringdater/ringdater_pkg") </p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
	<p>RingdateR requires R version 4.0. There are also a number of dependencies, listed in the help file, that will automatically install when the RingdateR package is first installed. If you are currently using an older version of R, you can automatically install the latest version using the following code: </p>

<p> install.packages("installr") </p>
	<p>library(installr) </p>
	<p>updateR() </p>

	<h3>Starting RingdateR</h3>
	<p>Once the RingdateR package is installed, use the following code to launch the RingdateR app:</p>
	<p>library(ringdater)</p>
	<p>run_ringdater()</p>

  <h3> Alternative RStudio start </h3>
  <p> If you encounter issues installing RingdateR from Github, you can also download the
    scripts to run RingdateR here. </p>

  <div class="online">
      <ul><li><a href="https://ringdater.github.io/ringdater/RingdateR_app_only.zip">
        <b>Download RingdateR script</b></a>
      </li></ul>
  </div>

  <p> Once downloaded, unzip the folder and open run_me.R in RStudio.
  Rstudio will detect the script is for an app, so simply click the Run App button that
  appears in the top right corner of the script window. RingdateR will launch in your
  default web browser.</p>
